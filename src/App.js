      react application with automated tests 
      already configured with JEST and React 
      Test Library.
      This is not the only thing that is configured 
      for you, with it you will be able to take 
      advantage of the Atomic Design pattern design 
      and the best of all? It is already integrated 
      with StoryBook!
